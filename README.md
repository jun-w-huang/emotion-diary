# Motivation
Emotions are a fundamental aspect of our lives that significantly influence the way in which we think, act, and feel. Despite this, most of us seldom spend much time reflecting on our emotions, how they make us feel, what they are caused by, and how they affect our behaviour for better or worse. Emotion Diary was created to help individuals better understand their emotional patterns so that they can ultimately take action to improve their emotional lives. 

This project was initially begun as a final project for the class Philosophy of Emotions, taught by Professor Jacob Stump at Northeastern University. Although I have since completed the course, I have continued to work on it in collaboration with Professor Stump, as well as my classmate and UX designer, Amanda Lee (lee.amand@northeastern.edu).

# Current State of Project
As of today, (9th September 2023), I have currently taken a (temporary?) break from developing the project, as I have been increasingly busy with other commitments. The app in its current state allows users to record their emotional events, answering prompts such as what emotion they are feeling, what caused the emotion, what is the emotion directed towards, and what the emotion actually feels like. Their events are then able to be viewed in an intuitive calendar UI. In addition, users are provided with an Analysis page where data visualization has been used to assist in providing insight into users's emotional patterns.

# Future of Emotion Diary
Moving forward, there are a lot of new interesting features that I'd like to work on developing for this project, but I haven't quite found the time yet. Some of these features I have in mind:
1. A mobile app or mobile support. Currently, the app is desktop only and it would certainly be useful to have it more accessible throughout one's day.
2. Integrate GenAI (of course) to serve as some sort of chat bot that could provide advice to our users or help to push them to discover their own answers via prompting them with questions. There is a lot of possibility here, but I need to spend more time to think about what would be most useful.
3. Improve current user flow. As of now, the project is just about at an MVP state, but the existing user flows could definitely use some fine tuning and rephrasing that would improve the way in which the concept of emotions are framed to the user.
